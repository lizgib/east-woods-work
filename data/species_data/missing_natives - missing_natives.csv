17,Arctium minus,i,9/26/18,certainly exotic invasive in fields though it's not really invasive in the woods
18,Barbarea vulgaris,x,9/26/18,
19,Osmorhiza aristata var. aristata,n,9/26/18,MISID: this is probably one of our native spp O. claytonii or O. longistylis... almost certainly misnamed.
20,Lamium purpureum,x,9/26/18,
21,Fallopia scandens,n,9/26/18,
22,Viola sororia var. missouriensis,n,9/26/18,I would leave this at V. sororia quite common

36,Rumex,??,9/26/18,There are many spp some native some note

42,Acalypha virginica var. rhomboidea,n,9/26/18,
43,Thelypteris confluens,n,9/26/18,I suspect this is misidentified (this sp. is from the OW tropics; https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/326164-Thelypteris-confluens); likelier to be Thelypteris palustris or Athyrium filix-femina (depending on the habitat and skill of the botanist)
44,Eupatorium maculatum,n,9/26/18,
45,Silene latifolia subsp. alba,x,9/26/18,

48,NA,I wouldn't hazard a guess,9/26/18,
49,Ligusticum,x,9/26/18,
50,Torilis,x,9/26/18,

52,Circaea lutetiana subsp. canadensis,n,9/26/18,
53,Allium tricoccum var. burdickii,n,9/26/18,
54,Calluna vulgaris,This is a Eurasian ericad not known from our area. There are two records from Urbana at ILLS do we have a specimen?,9/26/18,
55,Phaca,Genus not known from our area,9/26/18,
56,Ranunculus septentrionalis,n,9/26/18,
57, ,,,
58,Lonicera prolifera,n,9/26/18,Accepted name: Lonicera reticulata

62,Ailanthus altissima,i,9/26/18,
63,Leitneria floridana,x,9/26/18,Probably a cultivated plant living collections I think there is a stand of this on the N side of the road between P14 and P15
64,Gymnocladus dioica,n,9/26/18,
65,Malus pumila,x,9/26/18,apple!
66,Picea abies,x,9/26/18,living collections?
67,Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum,n,9/26/18,I would treat this Acer saccharum and Acer nigrum as the same thing

71,Sonchus asper,x,9/26/18,
72,Nonea,not reported from IL,9/26/18,
73,Panicum acuminatum,n,9/26/18,probably refers to Dichanthelium implicatum of which D. acuminatum implicatum is a synonym
74,Euthamia caroliniana,n,9/26/18,unlikely to be this species which is restricted to sandy soils primarily in IN and MI (it's a coastal plain disjunct) likelier to be E. graminifolia
75,Sedum,x,9/26/18,we have exotic spp and one native spp but the latter is rare
76,Grias,"This is a South American genus perhaps they meant ""grass""?",,
77,Persicaria lapathifolia,n,9/26/18,"Though see discussion in Wilhelm and Rereicha who write that the sp. ""probably consists of both native and European strains in our area."""

79,Brassicaceae,some are native some aren't,,
80,Persicaria punctata,n,9/26/18,
81,Fragaria vesca subsp. americana,n,9/26/18,I would treat Fragaria vesca and F. virginiana as synonyms for analysis I wouldn't be confident in differentiating these two in the field on the fly
82,Rumex britannica,n,9/26/18,Synonymous with R. orbiculatus which is how Wilhelm treats it though FNA has it under R. britannica
83,Lactuca serriola,x,9/26/18,
84,Trema,Two species squeak into N America only in Florida. Probably this should be treated as a Celtis.,9/26/18,
85,Ruta,x,9/26/18,Cultivated in our Tilia Rutaceae Dwarf Woody Plants and other collections... probably cultivated though it has cropped up between the greenhouses and may escape from cultivation.
